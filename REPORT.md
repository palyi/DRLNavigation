<h2>Learning algorithm</h2>

The software is implementing Deep Reinforcement Learning. The agent makes use of an artificial neural network to build and represent action-values as weights in the primary Q network and the target Q network as well.

<h2>Plot of rewards per episode</h2> 

The agent is able to receive an average reward (over 100 episodes) of at least +13.
