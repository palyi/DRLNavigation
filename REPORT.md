description of the implementation.

describes the learning algorithm, along with the chosen hyperparameters. It also describes the model architectures for any neural networks

A plot of rewards per episode is included to illustrate that the agent is able to receive an average reward (over 100 episodes) of at least +13. The submission reports the number of episodes needed to solve the environment.
