# DRLNavigation
Navigating by Deep Reinforcement Learning

The task solved by the contents of this repository is navigating in a finite space featuring colored objects (bananas). The agent of this reinforcement learning scenario is trained to collect as many of the target objects as possible.

Apart from the above introduction, this repository contains the code that used for training the agent, along with the trained model weights. Additionally, I attached a report describing my learning algorithm.
